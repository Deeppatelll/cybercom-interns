    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
            I am a final year Information Technology student at
            <strong>Dharamsinh Desai University</strong>.
            I am interested in building scalable web applications
            and backend systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have hands-on experience in full stack development,
            especially with the MERN stack. I have worked on
            real-world projects such as a real estate platform
            and also explored AI/ML through academic projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            Apart from development, I am comfortable working with
            tools like Git, GitHub, Postman, Insomnia, and IDEs such
            as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Android Studio.
        </p>

        <p>
            My goal is to continuously improve my technical skills
            and contribute to impactful software solutions.
